    `--dev` before you can now use the `-a/--auto-restart` flat. The `--dev` and `--reload` flags are kept for backwards compatibility.

 * Bug fix: When using a Sidebar or AppBar we would previously render the main `Page` component twice, this does not happen anymore: [#366](https://github.com/widgetti/solara/pull/366)
 * Documentation: Added a "Jupyter dashboard tutorial" part 1.
 * Documentation: Added documentation for [`use_effect`](https://solara.dev/api/use_effect), [`use_memo`](https://solara.dev/api/use_effect), and improved the documentation of [`use_thread`](https://solara.dev/api/use_thread).
