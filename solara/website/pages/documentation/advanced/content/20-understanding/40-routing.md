# Routing

Routing takes care of linking a web address (more specifically the [pathname](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location), e.g. "/docs/basics/solara") to a state of the UI,
usually in the form of what appears as pages to a user.


Routing includes navigation (hitting the back and forward button of your browser) without causing a page reload.


## Automatic routing

Setting up routing can be repetitive, and therefore Solara comes also with a more opinionated method for setting up routing automatically.

### Based on a directory

Using [`generate_routes_directory(path: Path) -> List[solara.Route]:`](/documentation/api/routing/generate_routes_directory) we can request Solara to give us a list of
routes by scanning a directory for Python scripts, Notebooks and Markdown files.

This function is being used by Solara if you run solara server with a directory as argument name, as used in [our Multi Page guide](/documentation/advanced/howto/multipage). More details can be found there.


### Based on a Python package

Similar to the previous section [`generate_routes(module: ModuleType) -> List[solara.Route]:`](/documentation/api/routing/generate_routes) will return a list of routes by scanning a Python package or module for `Page` components, or `app` elements. Again, more information can be found at [our Multi Page guide](/documentation/advanced/howto/multipage).

## Manually defining routes

In Solara, we set up routing by defining a list of `solara.Route` objects, where each route can have another list of routes, its children, forming
a tree of routes. We assign this list to the `routes` variable in your main app script or module.

### Defining route components

If no `Page` component is found in your main script or module, Solara will assume you have either set the `component` or the `module` argument of the `solara.Route` object.

For example

```python
import solara
from solara.website.pages.examples.utilities import calculator


@solara.component
def Home():
    solara.Markdown("Home")


@solara.component
def About():
    solara.Markdown("About")


routes = [
    solara.Route(path="/", component=Home, label="Home"),
    # the calculator module should have a Page component
    solara.Route(path="calculator", module=calculator, label="Calculator"),
    solara.Route(path="about", component=About, label="About"),
]
```

### Defining route components

If you do define a `Page` component, you are fully responsible for how routing is done, but we recommend using [use_route](/documentation/api/routing/use_route).

An example route definition could be something like this:

```python
import solara

routes = [
    # route level == 0
    solara.Route(path="/"),  # matches empty path ''
    solara.Route(
        # route level == 1
        path="docs",  # matches '/docs'
        children=[
            # route level == 2
            solara.Route(path="basics", children=[  # matches '/docs/basics'
                # route level == 3
                solara.Route(path="react"),      # matches '/docs/basics/react'
                solara.Route(path="ipywidgets"), # matches '/docs/basics/ipywidgets'
                solara.Route(path="solara"),     # matches '/docs/basics/solara'
            ]),
            solara.Route(path="advanced")  # matches '/docs/advanced'
        ],
    ),
    solara.Route(
        path="blog",
        # route level == 1
        children=[
            solara.Route(path="/"),   # matches '/blog'
            solara.Route(path="foo"), # matches '/blog/foo'
            solara.Route(path="bar"), # matches '/blog/bar'
        ],
    ),
    solara.Route(path="contact")  # matches '/contact'
]

# Lets assume our pathname is `/docs/basics/react`,
@solara.component
def Page():
    level = solara.use_route_level()  # returns 0
    route_current, routes_current_level = solara.use_route()
    # route_current is routes[1], i.e. solara.Route(path="docs", children=[...])
    # routes_current_level is [routes[0], routes[1], routes[2], routes[3]], i.e.:
    #    [solara.Route(path="/"), solara.Route(path="docs", children=[...]),
    #     solara.Route(path="blog", children=[...]), solara.Route(path="contact")]
    if route_current is None: # no matching route
        return solara.Error("oops, page not found")
    else:
        # we could render some top level navigation here based on route_current_level and route_current
        return MyFirstLevelChildComponent()
```

Routes are matched by splitting the pathname around the slash ("/") and matching each part to the routes. The level of the depth into the tree is what we call the `route_level`, which starts at 0, the top level.
Each call to `use_route` will return the current route (if there is a match to the current path) and the list of siblings including itself.


Now the `MyFirstLevelChildComponent` component is responsible for rendering the second level navigation:

```python
@solara.component
def MyFirstLevelChildComponent():
    level = solara.use_route_level()  # returns 1
    route_current, routes_current_level = solara.use_route()
    # route_current is routes[1].children[0], i.e. solara.Route(path="basics", children=[...])
    # routes_current_level is [routes[1].children[0], routes[1].children[1]], i.e.:
    #    [solara.Route(path="basics", children=[...]), solara.Route(path="advanced")]
    if route_current is None: # no matching route
        return solara.Error("oops, page not found")
    else:
        # we could render some mid level navigation here based on route_current_level and route_current
        return MySecondLevelChildComponent()

```

And the `MySecondLevelChildComponent` component is responsible for rendering the third level navigation:

```python
@solara.component
def MySecondLevelChildComponent():
    level = solara.use_route_level()  # returns 2
    route_current, routes_current_level = solara.use_route()
    # route_current is routes[1].children[0].children[0], i.e. solara.Route(path="react")
    # routes_current_level is [routes[1].children[0].children[0], routes[1].children[0].children[1], routes[1].children[0].children[2]], i.e.
    #    [solara.Route(path="react"), solara.Route(path="ipywidgets"), solara.Route(path="solara")]
    if route_current is None: # no matching route
        return solara.Error("oops, page not found")
    else:
        # we could render some mid level navigation here based on route_current_level and route_current
        if route_current.path == "react":
            return DocsBasicReact()  # render the actual content
        elif route_current.path == "ipywidgets":
            return DocsBasicIpyWidgets()
        elif route_current.path == "solara":
            return DocsBasicSolara()
        else:
            return solara.Error("oops, not possible!")

```

From this code, we can see we are free how we transform the routes into the state of the UI (i.e. which components are rendered).

## Adding data

Often, your render logic needs some extra data on what to display. For instance, you may want to dynamically render tabs based on the routes,
which requires you to have a label, and know which component to add.
For this purposed we added `label: str` and the `component' attributes, so you can defines routes likes:

```python
routes = [
    solara.Route("/", component=Home, label="What is Solara ☀️?"),
    solara.Route("docs", component=docs.App, label="Docs", children=docs.routes),
    solara.Route(
        "demo",
        component=demo.Demo,
        children=demo.routes,
        label="Demo",
    ),
    ...
]
```

In the case where you did not specify a `Page` component, label is used for the [Title](/documentation/components/page/title) component.

If you need to store more data in the route, you are free to put whatever you want in the `data` attribute, see also [Route](/documentation/api/routing/route).



## Linking

Note that all routes are relative, since a component does not know if it is embedded into a larger application, which may also do routing.


Therefore you should never use the `route.path` for navigation since the route object has no knowledge of the full url
(e.g. `/docs/basics/ipywigets`) but only knows its small piece of the pathname (e.g. `ipywidgets`)

Using [`resolve_path`](/documentation/api/routing/resolve_path) we can request the full url for navigation.

```python
def resolve_path(path_or_route: Union[str, solara.Route], level=0) -> str:
    ...
```

We can pass this full URL to the [`solara.Link`](/documentation/components/advanced/link) component, e.g. like:

```python
@solara.component
def LinkToIpywidgets():
    route_ipywidgets = routes.children[1].children[0].children[1]
    # route_ipywidgets.path == "ipywidgets"
    path = solara.resolve_path(route_ipywidgets)
    # path == '/docs/basics/ipywidgets
    with solara.Link(path) as main:
        solara.Button("read about ipywidgets")
    return main
```

## Fully manual routing

If you want to do routing fully manually, you can use the [`solara.use_router`](/documentation/api/routing/use_router) hook, and use the `.path` attribute.

```python
import solara


@solara.component
def Page():
    router = solara.use_router()
    path = router.path
    parts = path.split("/")
    solara.Markdown(f"Path = {path!r}, and split up into {parts!r}")
    # now you can do anything with path or parts.
    # e.g.
    # if parts[0] == "docs":
    #   solara.Markdown("You are in the docs section")
```
