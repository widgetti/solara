        [Domino Code Assist](https://www.dominodatalab.com/product/code-assist) (DCA) is a tool developed for [Domino Data Lab](https://www.dominodatalab.com/)
        which provides a simple, intuitive point-and-click interface for generating Python or R code.
        DCA uses many of the solara components to render the UI in the classical notebook and lab. Solara server is used to serve data apps.

        Domino code assist is deeply integrated in the Jupyter notebook.
