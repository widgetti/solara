        # TESSA by Planeto

        [Planeto](https://planeto-energy.ch/) developed a tool called [TESSA](https://planeto-energy.ch/solution/) for district heating & cooling planning.

        TESSA was prototyped in the Jupyter notebook using ipywidgets. Using solara, they are able to bring TESSA into production using the
        same technology stack.
